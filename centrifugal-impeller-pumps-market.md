<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Impeller Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-stage Pump</li><li>Single-stage Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal impeller pumps are categorized primarily into single-stage and multi-stage pumps based on their design and application. Single-stage pumps feature a single impeller that efficiently moves fluids at lower pressures, making them ideal for tasks like irrigation and water transfer. Multi-stage pumps, on the other hand, incorporate multiple impellers to generate higher pressures, suitable for applications like water supply, boiler feed, and industrial processes. The choice between the two depends on the required flow rate and pressure specifications.</p></p>
